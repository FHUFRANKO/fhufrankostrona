<analysis>
The AI engineer's work involved incrementally building and securing a React/FastAPI application for a car dealership (FHU Franko). Initial tasks focused on deploying the provided ZIP, analyzing the codebase, and making it runnable. Subsequent requests involved core feature development: migrating bus listings from mock data to a MongoDB backend, implementing a full CRUD admin panel for buses, and creating a dedicated Opinions section with its own CRUD and public display. Significant effort was then directed towards enhancing the admin panel's security with a hidden URL, password-based authentication, and integrating it with Supabase for optional JWT authorization. The final stage addressed fixing issues with admin panel access and enabling bus uploads, including a hybrid local/Supabase image storage solution, and refining the authentication flow.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to analyze a provided ZIP folder of a website and show a preview. This revealed a **FHU Franko** car dealership application built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB.

Subsequent requirements included:
1.  **Remove Mock Bus Listings:** Eliminate hardcoded bus listings and enable their addition through the admin panel, starting with an empty database.
2.  **Implement Bus Management:** Allow adding, editing, and deleting bus listings via the admin panel, including image uploads to Supabase (or locally if Supabase bucket isn't configured).
3.  **Remove Quick Filters:** Eliminate the quick filters section from the  (listings) page.
4.  **Update Homepage Text:** Change Nowe busy w ofercie co tydzień to Nowe busy w ofercie on the homepage.
5.  **Create Opinions Subpage:** Develop a new page () to display customer opinions (name, business type, positive comment, purchased vehicle). This required backend CRUD and an admin panel interface.
6.  **Refine Opinion Display:** Show only the first name (without surname) for opinions.
7.  **Display Opinions on Homepage:** Integrate API-fetched opinions into the homepage.
8.  **Implement Secure Admin Panel:**
    *   Add a hidden URL (e.g., ) for admin login.
    *   Implement password-based authentication for this hidden URL.
    *   Protect all  routes with a middleware redirecting unauthenticated users to the hidden login.
    *   Integrate Supabase JWT authentication for backend admin-only endpoints (optional, for per-endpoint authorization).
    *   Ensure the existing Panel Admina button on the homepage is removed.
    *   Refine the frontend routing to correctly redirect to the hidden admin login via the API.
9.  **Enable Bus Uploads:** Ensure the functionality to add new buses through the admin panel works correctly, including image uploads (with a hybrid local/Supabase storage solution implemented).

<pending_tasks>
-   The user still needs to manually create the bus-images bucket in Supabase if they wish to use Supabase for image storage instead of the local fallback.
-   No explicit pending tasks were given after the last update.

<current_work>
The immediate work prior to this summary was focused on fixing the bus creation/upload flow via the admin panel.
1.  **Image Upload Setup:** The AI engineer implemented a hybrid image storage solution. If the bus-images Supabase bucket exists, it will be used; otherwise, images will be saved locally to . Static serving for this local  directory was added in .
2.  **Admin Authorization Fix:** It was identified that the  decorator, which protects most admin API endpoints, was relying solely on Supabase JWT. Since the primary admin authentication was shifted to a cookie-based password, the  function was modified to also check for the  cookie, allowing authenticated admin users to interact with secure endpoints without a Supabase JWT. The  endpoint was also updated to work with this cookie-based authentication.
3.  **Bus Creation Test:** A test bus was successfully added directly via a  POST request to  using the  cookie, confirming the backend logic and cookie-based authorization were working.
4.  **Verification:** The  endpoint was queried, confirming 1 bus now existed in the database. The last action was attempting to verify the newly added bus on the public homepage, but it wasn't immediately visible, suggesting a need to scroll or re-evaluate the view.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify that the newly added bus is correctly displayed on the public homepage.
