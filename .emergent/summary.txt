The AI engineer's work evolved from initial app setup and feature implementation to extensive deployment and integration challenges. Initially, core CRUD functionality for buses and opinions was established, along with a secure admin panel using a hybrid cookie/Supabase JWT authentication. A major shift occurred with the user's decision to migrate from MongoDB to Supabase PostgreSQL for all data storage, leading to significant backend refactoring and database schema migration. Subsequent efforts focused on resolving numerous deployment issues on Railway (Nixpacks, Dockerfile, environment variables, Node.js version, Supabase Row Level Security). The latest task involved integrating an Otomoto scraper, which necessitated further backend/frontend modifications and database column additions. The conversation concluded with the user reporting new errors after the scraper implementation, indicating ongoing issues in the application's functionality.

<product_requirements>
The FHU Franko car dealership application, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB (later migrated to Supabase PostgreSQL), required several key features and fixes:
1.  **Bus Management:** Remove mock data, implement full CRUD for bus listings via an admin panel, including image uploads (initially hybrid local/Supabase, later solely Supabase Storage).
2.  **Website Refinements:** Remove quick filters from the listings page and update homepage text.
3.  **Opinions Section:** Create a dedicated  page and integrate opinions into the homepage, with admin CRUD for opinions and displaying only the first name publicly.
4.  **Secure Admin Panel:** Implement a hidden URL for admin login, password-based authentication, middleware protection for  routes, and integrate Supabase JWT for optional per-endpoint authorization. The public Panel Admina button was to be removed.
5.  **Deployment to Railway:** Configure the application for deployment on Railway, including Dockerfile setup, environment variable management, and addressing build/runtime issues.
6.  **Otomoto Integration:** Add a feature to the admin panel to import bus listing details (price, specifications) by providing an Otomoto URL, auto-filling the form, and indicating fields to be manually completed. The admin panel's bus addition form should match Otomoto's information and options.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), Supabase PostgreSQL (database), Supabase Storage (image storage).
-   **Authentication/Authorization:** Custom cookie-based password authentication for admin panel, Supabase JWT (initially for per-endpoint auth, adapted for cookie-based flow), Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase.
-   **Deployment:** Docker, Railway (hosting platform), Nixpacks (initial attempt), Supervisor (process manager).
-   **Web Scraping:** ,  for Otomoto data extraction.
-   **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components,  for notifications.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Supabase for database (PostgreSQL) and file storage.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : Main FastAPI application, refactored to use Supabase PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB. Contains API routes for  and  CRUD, admin authentication middleware, image upload logic (now to Supabase Storage), and a new Otomoto scraping endpoint.
-   : Main React router. Routes updated to support the hidden admin path and public opinion page.
-   : Fetches and displays real bus and opinion data via API.
-   : Displays bus listings, fetches real data.
-   : Displays detailed bus information. Modified to hardcode contact details as the  field no longer exists in Supabase, and to handle image URLs from Supabase.
-   : Admin interface for managing buses and opinions. Includes UI for new Otomoto import and handles graceful 401 errors.
-   : Form for bus creation/editing. Heavily modified to include new fields matching Otomoto, a URL input for Otomoto import, and integration with the backend scraper.
-   : Updated with new options for the bus form fields to match Otomoto.
-   : API client for bus operations. Updated to include  for cookie-based auth and a new  method.
-   : Created to containerize the application for Railway deployment, including frontend build steps and backend Python environment.
-   : SQL script to create  and  tables in Supabase PostgreSQL, including Row Level Security policies.
-   : SQL script to add new columns to the  table in Supabase, reflecting additional fields scraped from Otomoto.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- The user still needs to manually create the bus-images bucket in Supabase if they wish to use Supabase for image storage instead of the local fallback, and run the SQL policy scripts.
- The user needs to apply database schema updates () in their Supabase project to accommodate new fields for Otomoto integration.
- Address the widze jakies bledy na stronie reported by the user after the Otomoto scraper and form field updates.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on implementing the Otomoto scraping feature and expanding the bus listing form fields.
1.  **Otomoto Scraper Backend:** New dependencies (, ) were added to . A  endpoint was created in  to fetch data from an Otomoto URL. The bus model (, , ) was extended with new fields like , , , , , , , , .
2.  **Otomoto Scraper Frontend:**  was updated to include an input field for the Otomoto URL and a button to trigger the scraping. New state variables and a function () were added to handle fetching data and populating the form. New options for  were added for the expanded fields.
3.  **Supabase Schema Update:** A SQL script () was created to add these new columns to the  table in Supabase, but the user needs to execute it.
4.  **Deployment Fixes:** During this phase, several Dockerfile-related deployment errors on Railway were addressed:  not found (fixed by adjusting COPY commands) and  (fixed by removing  and ensuring all yarn install v1.22.22

5.  **Current Status:** The user reported widze jakies bledy na stronie (I see some errors on the page) after the latest changes were pushed, indicating a new set of issues after the Otomoto scraper integration and deployment fixes. The exact nature of these errors is yet to be diagnosed.
