<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory involved a significant refactoring and feature addition to the FHU Franko application, primarily driven by user requests. The work began with fixing a syntax error in frontend constants. The major task was a complete overhaul of the admin Add Listing form, requiring new database schema (Supabase PostgreSQL), Pydantic models, FastAPI endpoints, and a new React component (). Challenges included persistent Supabase schema cache issues, React Quill incompatibility requiring a switch to a simpler textarea, and continuous debugging of backend 500 errors due to unapplied SQL migrations. A key workaround was using the existing  field for the new SPRZEDANE status due to the  column not appearing in the Supabase schema cache. The latest iterations focused on refining the visual presentation and responsiveness of this SPRZEDANE overlay based on user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The FHU Franko car dealership application, built with React, FastAPI, and Supabase PostgreSQL, needed several key features and fixes:
1.  **Bus Management:** Full CRUD for bus listings via an admin panel, including image uploads to Supabase Storage. This was initially implemented, then a major update involved revamping the Add Listing form.
2.  **Website Refinements:** Remove quick filters and update homepage text (partially addressed by initial setup).
3.  **Opinions Section:** Dedicated  page and homepage integration, with admin CRUD and displaying only the first name publicly (initial implementation).
4.  **Secure Admin Panel:** Hidden URL for admin login, password-based authentication, middleware protection, and Supabase JWT integration (initial implementation).
5.  **Deployment to Railway:** Configuration including Dockerfile, environment variables, and troubleshooting build/runtime issues.
6.  **Otomoto Integration:** Feature in admin panel to import bus listing details from an Otomoto URL, auto-filling the form. This required expanding bus form fields (initially implemented).
7.  **New Listing System (Comprehensive Form Rebuild):** Rebuild the Add Listing form in the admin panel with four sections (Informacje podstawowe, Specyfikacja techniczna, Stan i historia pojazdu, Opis sprzedawcy). Implement detailed fields with specific types (string, integer, boolean, enum, date, URL, rich-text HTML), validations (e.g., VIN regex, price ranges), placeholders, suffixes (cmÂ³, KM, kg), datepickers, and toggle switches. This required new API endpoints () and corresponding database schema updates.
8.  **SPRZEDANE Overlay:** Add an option in the admin panel to mark an announcement as SPRZEDANE, displaying a large, red, semi-transparent overlay text on the listing's image on both the card view and detail page. This should function as a toggle.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), Supabase PostgreSQL (database), Supabase Storage (image storage).
-   **Authentication/Authorization:** Custom cookie-based password auth for admin, Supabase JWT, Row Level Security (RLS).
-   **Deployment:** Docker, Railway, Supervisor.
-   **Web Scraping:** ,  (for Otomoto).
-   **Data Validation:** Pydantic models, custom Python validators.
-   **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components,  (for notifications).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Supabase for database (PostgreSQL) and file storage.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : Major refactor. Added new FastAPI routes for  (, , ), integrated new Pydantic models from , imported . Fixed static file serving. Modified  model to include  field and mapped  to  in  endpoint.
-   : **New file.** Contains custom validation logic for VIN, URL, date, and numeric ranges as per new listing requirements.
-   : **New file.** Defines Pydantic s for , ,  with comprehensive fields and validations.
-   : **New file.** Replaces  as the new, multi-section form for creating/editing listings, incorporating all new fields, rich-text editor (using  as  workaround), and Otomoto scraper integration.
-   : Updated to include new API methods for the  system (, , ) and .
-   : Modified to import and use . Added UI for toggling the SPRZEDANE status for listings, directly updating the backend.
-   : Updated with new options for the expanded bus form fields.
-   : Modified to conditionally display a SPRZEDANE overlay on the vehicle image if  (or  as a workaround) is true. Added fallback for empty image arrays. Styling enhanced for the overlay.
-   : Modified to display the SPRZEDANE overlay on the main image if  (or ) is true. Added fallback for empty image arrays. Styling enhanced for the overlay.
-   : **New file.** Contains SQL  statements to add numerous new columns to the  table in Supabase, along with indexes and default values, to match the new listing system's requirements.
-   : **New file.** Instructions for the user to manually execute the .
-   : **New file.** Instructions for the user to manually execute SQL for the  column.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   The user still needs to manually execute the  script in Supabase to add all new columns to the  table.
-   The user still needs to ensure the  column is correctly integrated into Supabase and its schema cache is refreshed. The current implementation uses  as a workaround.
-   The user has requested to make the SPRZEDANE text on the overlay smaller.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was iteratively refining the styling and responsiveness of the SPRZEDANE overlay text. The user requested to make the text smaller and to ensure consistent scaling across devices. The AI engineer made changes to  and  to adjust the text size and added responsive Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., ) to ensure uniform appearance across different screen sizes. The opacity of the text and its background had also been adjusted based on earlier user feedback to prevent it from obscuring the bus image too much. The core functionality for toggling the SPRZEDANE status via the admin panel, using the  column as a temporary workaround, is in place and verified locally.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Adjust the font size of the SPRZEDANE overlay text in  and  to make it slightly smaller, as explicitly requested by the user.
